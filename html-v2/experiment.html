			<h1>The Experiment</h1>
			
			
			<p>It started after hearing of the Japanese word "Kaizen", which means "improvement" or "change for the better".   For some reason, this word resonated with me and led me to search for ways to improve  or change my life for the better. </p> 

			<p>To improve something requires quantifiable metrics that can be tracked, measured and compared over time.  This is a challenging  task considering there really is no way to quantify, track or measure life in general.</p>

			<h4>Lets start with money</h4>  
			<p>Some would say money is a way to measure one’s progress in life, however given the fact that each one of us is born of a different class in a different culture working different careers all with varying salaries and opportunities, one would quickly discover that this is an unfair, unrealistic and superficial way to measure ones life.  Money is a man-made creation and is not a good way to "measure" life.</p>  
			
			<h4>How about physical abilities?</h4> 
			<p>Like money, this can’t be used as each one of us is born with varying physical abilities, thus is a poor measurement of life.</p>
			
			
			<h4>What about size of your family or your social network?</h4> 
			<p>This won’t work either, again each one of us is born of different circumstances which leads to varying family and social lives. </p>
			
			
			<h4>Then how do we measure life?</h4>
			<p>In order to measure life you need to have a blueprint, a set of life principles that can be used universally across all genders, races and nationalities.  These principles need to be simple, easy to understand and free of religion.</p>   
			

			<h4>Benjamin Franklin’s 13 Principles</h4>
			<p>In search for moral perfection, Ben Franklin developed a personal improvement program that consisted of 13 virtues.  These principles are simple and work universally and are the basis of this app.  </p>
			
			
			<h4>The Requirements</h4>
			<p>Following these principles requires a person to be honest, hard working, focused and most of all thoughtful.</p>  

			
			<h4>The Benefits</h4>
			<p>There are no immediate benefits.  If you are goal oriented, this may help you in reaching your goals.  If you want to live with no regrets, then by doing your best make the most of life while using these principles as the blueprint will help you reach your goals and live without regret. </p>
			
			
			<!-- <h4>This is kind of demanding</h3>
			<p>Yes it is.</p> -->

				<h4>A few notes about this app</h4>
				<ol class="notes">
					<li>There are a lot of great philosophers out there all with their own ideas on how to maximize life.  Ben Franklin's principles are clear and easy to follow.</li>
					<li>There is a limit on the number of accounts, reason being that there is only 1 developer working on the application and would like to give time to discover possible issues or bugs</li>
