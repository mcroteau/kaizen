*****  The Experiment  *****

Franklins 13 is a social experiment created to try to help keep us humans in focus on what's important in our life.  No religion involved here... so get over it...  Just simple principles that sometimes some of us need to be reminded of.

Franklins 13 is based on Benjamin Franklin's 13 Principles.  The principles are simple and if followed will help each individual live a happy, productive and fulfilling life.... well, at least that was his goal when he created them.
