	<p class="note">
		<em>A Note About the "Modern Day Personal Virtue" : </em> In using this app for a little over a week, I found that even with the best of days I still felt like I was missing something.  That thing was living a healthy lifestyle.   This new virtue (if you want to call it that) overlaps with others Franklin listed.  However, Franklin never mentioned exercise and I think people underestimate the value of regular exercise.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		This doesn't mean become a gym rat or a health nut.. use your best judgement.  Remember, moderation is a virtue and should be applied to all areas of life, including the amount of effort/energy you put into being "Healthy" 
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		One more thing, you should take it easy on the booze and other extracurricular party activities
