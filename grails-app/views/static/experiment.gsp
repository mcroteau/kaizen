	<h1>The Experiment</h1>
	
	<!-- <div class="icon"></div> -->
	<p class="large experiment">
		Franklins 13+ is a personal attempt at keeping myself in check, and decided to open to others who might find this kind of thing interesting. No religion involved here...  just simple principles that some of us often needed to be reminded of. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="large experiment">
		Franklins 13+ is based on Benjamin Franklin's 13 Principles. The principles are simple and if followed could help any of us live a happy, productive and fulfilling life... well, at least that was his goal when he created them.
	</p>

		<em>Why create this app?</em><br/>
		Why not?  Franklin was a producer, someone who was not perfect but strived to be the best version of himself daily.  This is just a simple app to help those who might be interested in doing the same.  
	</p>

	
	<p class="large">
		<em>Whats up with the plus?</em><br/>
		Ben Franklin probably never went to the gym to get a good jog in...  however, from my personal experience, exercising and eating a healthy diet has proven to me to be beneficial to my overall health &amp; well being.  Because of this, “Well Being” was added to the list of virtues thus the plus.

		<em>Why is there a limit on the number of accounts?</em><br/>			

		This is a side project, so I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to fix bugs or reply to emails not to mention not sure if others will find utility in a small application like this.

	<h2>A few notes about this app</h2>
	<ol class="notes">
		<li>This app is free to use, developed by 1 person who plans on using himself, so bugs will exist.  If you discover a bug please send an email to franklins13app@gmail.com.</li>
		<li>Some of the content on this site will contain personal opinions... this is not meant to stir up any kind of debate.  Thanks for understanding... </li>
		<li>Lets be honest here, most of us know deep down how to live...  however, it is a personal belief that if you are not measuring certain aspects of your life daily, how do you know what to improve upon or if you need to address something in your life.  Why try to improve daily?  Because if you aren't.. then to me, you're stale, stagnant... you're stunting your growth.  Again, if this stirs something up in you, then refer to #2 on this list. </li>  
		<li>Thanks for visiting, wish you the best.</li>
