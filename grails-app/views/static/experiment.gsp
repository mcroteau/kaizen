	<p class="large experiment">
		Will we be happier if we follow principles that are simple yet require us to be thoughtful, disciplined & hard working?
	</p>

	<p class="large experiment">
		Franklins 13+ is a social experiment created to try to help keep us humans focused on what's important in life. No religion involved here... so get over it. These are just simple principles that we often needed to be reminded of.
	</p>
	
	<p class="large experiment">
		Franklins 13+ is based on Benjamin Franklin's 13 Principles. The principles are simple and if followed will help each individual live a happy, productive and fulfilling life.... well, at least that was his goal when he created them.

		<em>Why create this app?</em><br/>
		Really, a personal experiment that I thought I might share with others who might think is valuable. 
	</p>

		<em>Whats up with the plus?</em><br/>
		Ben Franklin probably never went to the gym to get a good jog in...  however, exercising and eating a healthy diet has proven to be beneficial to your overall health & well being.  Because of this, “Well Being” was added to the list of virtues thus the plus.

		<em>Why is there a limit on the number of accounts?</em><br/>			

		Because this is a new application, it is best to see how users are going to interact with the application to discover possible issues before opening up to everyone....
