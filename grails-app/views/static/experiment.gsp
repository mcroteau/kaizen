	<p class="large">Will we be happier if we follow principles that are simple yet require us to be thoughtful, disciplined &amp; hard working?</p>
	
	<p class="medium">Franklins 13 is a social experiment created to try to help keep us humans in focus on what's important in our life.  No religion involved here... so get over it.  These are just simple principles that we often needed to be reminded of.</p>

	<p>Franklins 13 is based on Benjamin Franklin's 13 Principles.  The principles are simple and if followed will help each individual live a happy, productive and fulfilling life.... well, at least that was his goal when he created them.</p>
